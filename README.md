### Educator ▸ Curriculum Designer ▸ Creative Technologist  
✦ *“We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master.”* — Ernest Hemingway  

Welcome to my GitHub profile. This space documents my work as an educator and curriculum designer specializing in **programming logic, mobile/web development, and ethical pedagogy**.  

I believe in teaching through **systems thinking, narrative-driven assignments, and transparent reporting**. My repositories are not just code, they are scaffolds for learning, designed to help students and collaborators understand both the *how* and the *why* behind programming. Each example begins simply and grows in stages, showing not only the mechanics of code but the reasoning behind design choices. My goal is to model thought processes so that learners can adapt them, develop their own style, and ultimately discover new pathways to solving problems.

## ✦ Teaching Philosophy  

I set high standards from the very first lesson. Code must be neat, presentable, and readable, with clear variable names and proper indentation. These practices are not cosmetic, they shape understanding and make logic visible.  

I also emphasise the value of errors. Syntax, run-time, and logical mistakes are not failures but opportunities to sharpen debugging skills and resilience. In pseudocode, where no compiler exists, students themselves become the “machine,” executing logic in their minds. This builds discipline and confidence.  

Above all, I remind students: *“You need to be better than me when I am done teaching you. Show me new pathways to solving problems that even I have not seen before.”*

## ✧ Beyond Code  

Photography and creative coding are extensions of my teaching philosophy. Photography teaches composition and colour—how elements come together to tell a story. Coding, too, is about framing problems and imagining results before they exist.  

Through Processing and p5js, I explore how logic can be visualised. A simple algorithm like bubble sort becomes a dynamic visualisation, bridging academic exercises with creative storytelling. These explorations show students that programming is not only technical but expressive, and that creative coding can make the subject less intimidating for beginners.

### ❖ Closing Note  

This profile is more than a collection of repositories—it is a reflection of my teaching journey. Visitors can explore these subjects and projects to understand the systems I’ve designed, the philosophy that guides my work, and the legacy I hope to build through education and collaboration.
