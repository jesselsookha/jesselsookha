### Educator ▸ Curriculum Designer ▸ Creative Technologist  

Welcome to my GitHub profile. This space documents my work as an educator and curriculum designer specializing in **programming logic, mobile/web development, and ethical pedagogy**.  

I believe in teaching through **systems thinking, narrative-driven assignments, and transparent reporting**. My repositories are not just code—they are scaffolds for learning, designed to help students and collaborators understand both the *how* and the *why* behind programming.  

- ✦ Interests: coding, curriculum design, and photography  
- ➤ Currently teaching: programming logic, mobile app scripting, and responsive web design

## ✦ Teaching Philosophy  

I design learning experiences that are:  
- ▸ **Narrative-driven**: assignments simulate real-world scenarios to make abstract concepts tangible.  
- ▸ **Transparent**: clear rubrics, annotated resources, and ethical reporting practices.  
- ▸ **Modular**: step-by-step walkthroughs, parallel arrays, and component-based design for scalable learning.  
- ▸ **Creative**: blending technical rigor with aesthetic engagement, whether in code or photography.

## ✧ Beyond Code  

Outside of teaching and coding, I explore **photography** as another way to frame systems, beauty, and creativity. Both lenses—technical and artistic—help me see connections between logic, design, and storytelling.
